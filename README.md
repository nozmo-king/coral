## 🌟 What Makes Coral Unique?

Coral isn't just another cryptocurrency—it's a **revolutionary approach to fair, democratic mining** that puts power back in the hands of everyday users.

### ⚡ **Extreme Genesis Security**
- **Astronomical Difficulty**: 21e800 (21 followed by 800 zeros)
- **Header-Only Genesis**: Completely unspendable genesis block
- **Embedded Message**: "FUCK SATOSHI! Był głupim snobem" (Polish: "FUCK SATOSHI! He was a foolish snob")
- **Impossible to Manipulate**: Genesis block requires computational power beyond current technology

### 🎯 **True CPU Democracy**
- **RandomX Algorithm**: ASIC-resistant, CPU-optimized proof-of-work
- **Fair Mining**: No ASIC dominance, anyone with a computer can participate
- **Memory-Hard**: Uses ~2GB RAM per thread, prevents specialized hardware advantage
- **Global Accessibility**: Mine with your laptop, desktop, or server

### 🚀 **Enhanced Economics**
- **Block Time**: 10 minutes (stable and predictable)
- **Initial Reward**: 100 CORAL per block
- **Unique Quartering**: Rewards divide by 4 (not 2) every 210,000 blocks
- **Deflationary**: Maximum supply more limited than Bitcoin

### 🛡️ **Proven Security Foundation**
- **Bitcoin Core Base**: Built on the most battle-tested blockchain codebase
- **Complete Rebrand**: Every "Bitcoin" reference replaced with "Coral"
- **Modern Features**: Latest security improvements and optimizations
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Decentralized network with flood protection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Windows Users
1. **Download**: Get `Coral-1.0.0-Windows-Setup.exe` from [Releases](https://github.com/nozmo-king/coral/releases)
2. **Install**: Run installer as Administrator
3. **Mine**: Launch "Coral Mining" from Start Menu
4. **Expected Performance**: 500-8000 H/s depending on your CPU

### For Linux/macOS Users
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nozmo-king/coral.git
cd coral

# Install dependencies (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential libtool autotools-dev \
automake pkg-config bsdmainutils python3 libssl-dev libevent-dev \
libboost-system-dev libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-test-dev \
libboost-thread-dev libdb-dev libdb++-dev git

# Build Coral
./autogen.sh

## 📊 Mining Performance Guide

| CPU Type | Expected Hash Rate | Power Usage | Profitability |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|---------------|
| 4-core Laptop | 500-2000 H/s | 45-65W | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 8-core Desktop | 1500-4000 H/s | 95-150W | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 16-core Workstation | 3000-8000 H/s | 180-300W | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 32+ core Server | 8000+ H/s | 400W+ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

### 🎯 **Optimization Tips**
- **Use N-1 cores** (leave 1-2 cores for system operations)
- **Ensure 8GB+ RAM** (RandomX is memory-intensive)
- **Monitor temperatures** (mining generates heat)
- **Stable internet connection** for consistent mining
- **SSD storage** for faster blockchain sync

## 🏗️ **Network Specifications**

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Algorithm** | RandomX | CPU-optimized, ASIC-resistant |
| **Block Time** | 10 minutes | Consistent, predictable blocks |
| **Block Reward** | 100 CORAL | High initial rewards |
| **Halving** | Quartering every 210k blocks | More deflationary than Bitcoin |
| **Port** | 8334 | Mainnet connection port |
| **Address Prefix** | '1' (P2PKH), 'c' (P2SH) | Coral-specific addressing |
| **Bech32 HRP** | coral | Modern address format |

## 🌍 **Why Coral Matters**

### **Democratic Mining**
Unlike Bitcoin, where ASIC farms dominate, Coral's RandomX algorithm ensures anyone with a CPU can compete fairly. This creates true decentralization and prevents mining monopolies.

### **Environmental Responsibility**
CPU mining is significantly more energy-efficient than ASIC mining. Coral promotes sustainable cryptocurrency that doesn't require massive power consumption or specialized hardware waste.

### **Financial Accessibility**
No need for expensive mining equipment. Your existing computer can start earning Coral immediately, making cryptocurrency accessible to everyone globally.

### **Technical Innovation**
- **Memory-hard algorithm** prevents ASIC development
- **Extreme genesis security** prevents network manipulation
- **Proven codebase** built on Bitcoin Core's foundation
- **Modern optimizations** for better performance
